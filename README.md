# Alor28 Coding Style Guide

## General Principles

### 1. Consistency
- Write code in a consistent style across the entire codebase.
- Follow the agreed-upon guidelines even if they differ from personal preferences.

### 2. Readability
- Write code that is easy to read and understand.
- Use descriptive names for variables, functions, and classes.
- Write comments to explain the purpose of complex code segments.

### 3. Maintainability
- Write code that is easy to maintain and extend.
- Avoid code duplication by using functions and modules.
- Use version control systems (e.g., Git) to manage changes.

## Python Coding Style

### 1. Naming Conventions
- Variables and function names: `snake_case`
- Class names: `CamelCase`
- Constants: `UPPER_CASE_WITH_UNDERSCORES`

### 2. Indentation
- Use 4 spaces per indentation level.

### 3. Line Length
- Limit lines to 79 characters.

### 4. Imports
- Import standard libraries first, then third-party libraries, and local modules last.
- Use absolute imports whenever possible.

### 5. Docstrings
- Use triple double quotes for docstrings.
- Include a summary, parameters, return values, and exceptions.

```python
def example_function(param1, param2):
    """
    Summary of the function.

    Parameters:
    param1 (int): Description of param1.
    param2 (str): Description of param2.

    Returns:
    bool: Description of the return value.
    """
    # Function implementation
    pass
```

### 6. Code Layout
- Separate top-level function and class definitions with two blank lines.
- Separate method definitions inside a class with one blank line.
- Use spaces around operators and after commas, but not directly inside brackets.

### 7. Exceptions
- Use specific exception types.
- Use `try`/`except` blocks to handle exceptions.

```python
try:
    # Code that may raise an exception
    pass
except SpecificException as e:
    # Handle the exception
    pass
```

## JavaScript Coding Style

### 1. Naming Conventions
- Variables and functions: `camelCase`
- Classes: `CamelCase`
- Constants: `UPPER_CASE_WITH_UNDERSCORES`

### 2. Indentation
- Use 2 spaces per indentation level.

### 3. Line Length
- Limit lines to 80 characters.

### 4. Semicolons
- Use semicolons to terminate statements.

### 5. Quotes
- Use single quotes for strings, unless the string contains single quotes.

### 6. Functions
- Use arrow functions for anonymous functions.

```javascript
const add = (a, b) => a + b;
```

### 7. Comments
- Use `//` for single-line comments.
- Use `/* */` for multi-line comments.

### 8. Code Layout
- Separate logical blocks with blank lines.
- Align assignments and declarations when possible.

### 9. Promises
- Use `async`/`await` for handling promises.

```javascript
async function fetchData() {
    try {
        const response = await fetch(url);
        const data = await response.json();
        return data;
    } catch (error) {
        console.error(error);
    }
}
```

## Best Practices

### 1. Code Reviews
- Conduct code reviews to ensure code quality and share knowledge.

### 2. Testing
- Write tests for your code.
- Use testing frameworks appropriate for your language (e.g., `unittest` for Python, `Jest` for JavaScript).

### 3. Documentation
- Maintain clear and comprehensive documentation.
- Document APIs, modules, classes, and functions.

### 4. Version Control
- Use a version control system (e.g., Git).
- Commit changes with meaningful commit messages.
- Use branching strategies to manage features, fixes, and releases.

### 5. Security
- Follow security best practices.
- Validate and sanitize all inputs.
- Keep dependencies up to date.
